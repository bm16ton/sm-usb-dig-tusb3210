The Keyspan USA-19HS USB to Serial adaptor
includes a TUSB3410 chip and is easily modified
to convert it into a generic development platform.

Note that Keyspan makes adaptors with slightly
different model numbers that use completely different
microcontrollers. I have only tested the USA-19HS,
and I know it's different from the USA-19 which uses
the EZ-USB chip.

In order to load your own firmware using the RAM
bootloader, all you need to do is desolder the EEPROM.
This is the small 8-pin IC to the right of the TUSB3410.
The '3410 ROM will not find valid firmware, so it will
connect to the USB bus as a bootloader device.

The EEPROM that has been removed was the only device
on the USA-19HS's I2C bus. The P3.0 pin lights the
power LED when low, the P3.1 pin enables the RS-232
line driver when high. The other two GPIOs don't seem
to be connected.

For prototyping using the GPIOs and I2C bus, the
Keyspan adaptor can be easily adapted for use with
solderless breadboards. The method I used was as follows:

 1. Cut a piece of perfboard (the kind with small copper
    rings around each hole) about the same size as the
    USA-19HS board.

 2. Near the center of the perfboard, perpendicular to
    the long dimension of the board, solder on some
    0.1" headers. These will plug in to your solderless
    breadboard, so adjust the spacing accordingly.

 3. Solder some fairly heavy solid wire to the shield
    terminals of the USB and RS-232 connectors on the
    USA-19HS board. Plase the USA-19HS board and the
    perfboard with their solder sides back to back, and
    these thick wires fed through the perfboard. Solder
    between the grounds on the USA-19HS and the adjacent
    copper rings on the perfboard. Fold down the thick
    wires and solder them to each other on either side
    of the board.

    This will mechanically secure the two boards together,
    with the 0.1" headers sticking out the bottom. Since
    the pins on the ground terminals are longer than
    anything else on the bottom of the USA-19HS, there
    shouldn't be any risk of shorting anything. You should
    now be able to plug the USA-19HS into a breadboard
    quite securely.

 4. Solder 30 gauge wires to the pins of interest on the
    TUSB3410. Run them through the perfboard (to secure
    them mechanically) and wire-wrap them to the 0.1"
    header pins.

    I used the following pin assignments. Pin 1 is at the
    top right, when looking at the prototype from the top
    with the USB socket facing you, and pin numbers increase
    toward the right:
