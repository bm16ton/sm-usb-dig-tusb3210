- Linux 2.6, and possibly other operating systems, request more data
  than we have when reading string descriptors. Linux will read 255
  bytes, expecting to get less. Our firmware will then send however
  much data is actually available and let the host ACK.

  If the data to be sent, however, is a multiple of the packet size
  (8 bytes) the host will never see the partially full packet that it
  uses to detect an aborted transfer. This gives the host a timeout error.

  Attempts to fix this by sending back empty or 1-byte packets have
  not been successful so far, so currently we just avoid string
  descriptors that are multiples of 8 bytes long.
